# covid19-analysis

COVID-19 reached every place on the earth. An examination of open data from MÃ©xico will reveal the situation there. This paper aims to describe it by showing plenty of plots and graphs, explaining how to develop them in the process.

The purpose, to strengthen my general analysis skills, practicing methods used to produce high-quality materials like this web page and the media displayed in it.

The data is being manipulated with **[Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)** 13.0.0, splitting the rows with the rust crate, **[split-csv](https://github.com/AOx0/csv-split)**, into 101 smaller files for easier processing.

The result can be viewed **[here]( https://aox0.github.io/blog/covid/)**
