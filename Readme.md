# covid19-analysis

COVID19 hit every place on the earth. An analysis of open data from México will reveal the overall situation in México.

This paper aims to describe it by showing plenty of plots and graphs with emphasis at explaining how they where produced.

The purpose is to improve general data analysis and manipulation ability, practicing methods used to produce high quality materials like this web page and the media displayed in it.

The html was generated using Ulysses HTML export feature with **[ math-article](https://github.com/AOx0/math-article)** stylesheet and MathJax to render any LaTeX.

The data is being manipulated with **[Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)** 13.0.0, splitting the rows with the rust crate, **[split-csv](https://github.com/AOx0/csv-split)**, into 101 smaller files for easier processing.

The result can be viewed **[here]( https://aoxo.me/p/covid/)**
